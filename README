CHAT_LAB


I attached screenshot that shows chat between 3 users in SHELL.
client.c is a client file, server.c is a server file.
MAKEFILE compiles needed files

To build the code type: make all
To start the server type: ./server 'number_of_the_port'
To use a client type: ./client 'name_of_the_host' 'number_of_the_port'

Submitted code allows users to talk to each other (10 at most).
The usage specifications are below. 

  NOTE: I ASSUMED THAT MESSAGES SHOULD BE DELIVERED ONLY WITH THE USAGE OF /POST
  USAGE: 
  
  Once connected to server you can type:
       
  /USER 'username' - to set up your username
  /POST 'message' - to send your message to all the connected users to the server
  /WHO - request a list of people who are currently connected to the server  
  /HELP - to get all the possible options of commands in the chat lab
  /QUIT - to disconnect from the server
